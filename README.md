WIN18 ECE180 Team4 Final Project - Yelp data chanllenge

PURPOSE:
This project aims to explore the yelp dataset and help both customers and business to gain a better user experience. The main purpose is to predict user-restaurant ratings. As the number of restaurants explode, it becomes harder and harder to recommend a restaurant that a particular user might like. We would like to build a recommendation system that would recommend restaurants based on personal preferences. Also, restaurants could improve their resource allocation based on checkin data to improve service and dining environment. 


DATA ACQUISITION AND ANALYSIS:
For this project, we use dataset from Yelp Dataset Challenge. This dataset contains informations of restaurants, users and reviews. Details of this dataset can be found on this following url https://www.yelp.com/dataset/documentation/json. JSON files will be converted to CSV files for more efficient memory. Numpy and pandas package will be used for data manipulation. For our tasks, packages like SKLEARN will be used. Matplotlib will be the main tools for data visualization. Our goal is to predict ratings for particular user-restaurant pair. For this project, hybrid collaborative filtering and latent factor model will be used. Evaluation is based on root mean square error.
